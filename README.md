# SoftwareThatMatters
This document contains the code that was used during the [Research Project](https://github.com/TU-Delft-CSE/Research-Project) (2022 edition) of [TU Delft](https://github.com/TU-Delft-CSE). This repository contains 3 subdivisions. Each of these contains its own `README.md` file that provides more context. The subdivisions are:

- `data_processing` - contains scripts that can be applied to the raw collected data in order to prepare it to be imported into the graph.
- `graph_implementation_go` - represents the main implementation of the graph.
- `graph_implementation_rust_ATTEMPT` - contains a basic graph implementation written in Rust. This was just an attempt but it could be use as a starting point to develop a fully fledged graph implementation in Rust.

### Data

The raw data, the processed data and the results obtained during this research can all be found uploaded to [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6659483)
